# home_git
jdw's main home page for github
I am currently using this file to log my experiences with github. 
2/19/21: my website was working fine, but then I overwrote my index.html file, and the website hasn't worked since.
here is what is listed as the published url: jwecon.github.io/home_git/
but the message i get is: 404 File not found 
The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file.
